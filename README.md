Title: Exploring the Impact of Weather Conditions on Bike Ridership
A Data Wrangling Approach in Python

This project presents a comprehensive approach to data wrangling using Python,
 aimed at transforming raw data into a more usable format
 for downstream data analysis and machine learning applications.

 Leveraging powerful Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, 
we developed a robust pipeline for cleaning, transforming, 
and visualizing complex datasets.

 Our methodology involved handling missing data, outliers, 
and inconsistent data entries and reshaping data structures for optimal analysis.
